for monte carlo.
make an array of 32.

for the first index (0) the value is the rank of the current hand.
for the second index (1) take the first card out of your deck. 
Simulate 10,000 redraws out of your current deck of 32. 
Every redraw creates a new hand which has a rank. 
Add up all these ranks divide by 10,000. Add them to the array.

Seven high is the worst hand.

It goes spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds


MC advisor, two main functions.

- grade function(Hand h){ }

what's a grade? a number from 1 to 117?

lowest hand would be value 1 (not possible)
13 = high card ace.

14 = pair of twos.

32 different decisions. (5 choose 0) ... (5 choose 5) = 32
MC advisor needs to make a recommendation for one of these.

deal out a million hands
record what happens each time

...start with 0... play 0 is get 5 new cards
do this a million times, iterations (n) /* n could be 1,000,000 or 100,000 */

each time record the grade for the current hand. use a 2d array. 
Int of results[32][117]
		results[0][+2]++;

for each grade compute a probability (expectation value)
